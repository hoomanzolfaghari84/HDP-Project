\addAbstract{
		The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) has emerged as a pivotal theoretical concept for understanding the training dynamics and generalization properties of Neural Networks. This proposal outlines a research agenda aimed at extending NTK theory to encompass advanced neural network architectures, broader data distributions. By addressing current limitations and exploring novel applications, this research seeks to deepen the theoretical foundations of deep learning and enhance the practical utility of NTK in guiding the design and optimization of modern neural networks.
