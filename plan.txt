Contrastive Loss
GNN
Multi-modal

Online Optimization Tangent Kernel.
Even Activations in Supurios (less HDP)

==
Density Estimation (Likelihood loss) (too simple to be not done already)
sub-Gaussian (might be too simple or impossible result)  + see if practical possible

==
VC-dim or Radamacher (already done some), pseudo-dimension
Some finite-width layers.
